# valkyre-customs
### tool structure:
- 3 individual tools
- Script.js : common js for all interfaces
- Individual functional/algorithmic js for the indiviual files under xxxx.js
- Fonts are all physically accessed from their otf/tff files and are explictly declared under all_fonts.css
- Folder mt contains all used assets 
- All pages have their own checkout redirected page (will generate order_id from this endpoint!)
> :warning: **All these files have been tested for functionality and need no additional changes**: reach out to [Anand :)](https://github.com/Anandsure) before making changes
### pending work:
- Need to generate an order from a server, hence need to accomadate this in any web framework
